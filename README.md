# Browser-Messenger-App
This project is intended to perform a few commands. First of all, the user needs to be logged in with a nickname, without the need for a database. The entered users are expected to be displayed in the list via one of the online or offline tags. In case the user logs out, it is expected that they will be able to disconnect with the logout button. This situation is controlled as online / offline updates every 15 seconds. Permission control is made for private messaging. If the connection request is accepted, the messages will be between the two clients. And a 3rd client cannot see these messages. The project is created with nodejs and html.
